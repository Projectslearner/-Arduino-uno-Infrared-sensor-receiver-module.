# -Arduino-uno-Infrared-sensor-receiver-module.
The Arduino Uno Infrared Sensor Receiver Module detects infrared (IR) signals emitted by IR transmitters. It typically includes an IR receiver and a circuit to demodulate the received signals, enabling applications such as remote control systems, IR communication, and obstacle detection in robotics and automation projects.
